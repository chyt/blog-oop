Closing thoughts on my experience in Object-Oriented Programming.

# Lectures

Overall, the lectures are decently interesting. Professor Downing explains the concepts well, although his teaching style is a bit unorthodox. Specifically, he calls on students in class and asks them questions in order to improve and encourage student participation, but many of these questions are rhetorical and I feel like it is less clear as a third party trying to follow the conversaation between Professor Downing and the student he called on, than if he was just explaining the material in a traditional lecture format. 

The quizzes were definitely tough, as Professor Downing often times makes the questions tricky on purpose, and my quiz average ended up being really low for the course. However, part of this was also on me as I didn't regularly review the material presented in previous classes. 

# Projects

The first two projects, Collatz and Netflix, I felt didn't really teach any OOP concepts at all, but perhaps their purpose was to get us familiar with all the tools that we were using, and C++ fundamentals. However, the last three projects definitely improved my OOP knowledge, so I think in the end the projects ended up being a decent learning experience.

# Exams

Exams were not too difficult, and relatively straightforward. The only thing is that there was quite a bit of material covered in each exam, as there are only two throughout the semester. However, I guess it's also fortunate that the exams are not cumulative and there is no final.

# Conclusion

Overall, the course was a pretty good experience for me. I definitely imrpoved my skills in C++ significantly throughout the semester, and I learned a decent amount of OOP as a whole. The class did not take too much time and the grading was fair. I think what we learned also applies to the work environment, much more so than your typical CS class.
